This is a general package update to the CURRENT release repository.

# Important Notes
* "sysutils/hal" has been blacklisted from Project Trident and is no longer available in the package repositories. This is due to a decade of bitrot and ongoing security concerns:
   * HAL was placed in [maintenance mode in May 2008](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/hal/)
   * The current HAL FreeBSD port (0.5.14) was [added in May 2010](https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/hal)
   * The last commit to the HAL sources was in [October 2011](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/hal/log/)
   * There are security concerns with HAL, including the "Bald Eagle" exploit which was [revealed in 2017](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_9535850.html).
* As a side effect of blacklisting the "hal" port, all ports which have an *explicit* dependency on hal are automatically ignored by the package build system and will no longer have packages available in the Project Trident repositories. Some of these packages include:
   * The XFCE desktop environment
   * The MATE desktop environment
   * The GNOME desktop environment
   * The Cinnamon desktop environment.
   * To notify the appropriate FreeBSD port maintainers about the HAL dependency issue, please create bug tickets on [bugs.freebsd.org](https://bugs.freebsd.org)
