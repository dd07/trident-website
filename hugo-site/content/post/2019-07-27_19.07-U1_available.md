This is a general package update to the CURRENT release repository.

# Important Notes
* "sysutils/hal" has been blacklisted from Project Trident and will no longer be available in the package repositories due to ongoing security concerns.
   * Utility was put into maintenance mode in May of 2008
   * Current version of FreeBSD port was added in May of 2010
   * Last maintenance commit to the upstream utility was in October of 2011
   * There have been security reports about hal for years, including the "Bald Eagle" exploit which was announced in a [2017 Wikileaks document release](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_9535850.html).
* As a side effect of blacklisting the "hal" port, all ports which have an *explicit* dependency on hal are automatically ignored by the package build system and will no longer have packages available in the Project Trident repositories. Some of these packages include:
   * The XFCE desktop environment
   * The MATE desktop environment
   * The GNOME desktop environment
   * The Cinnamon desktop environment.
   * None of these desktops are officially supported by Project Trident, but if you are manually installing and using these desktops, you will need to contact the relevant FreeBSD port maintainers to get the HAL dependency issue resolved: [bugs.freebsd.org](https://bugs.freebsd.org)
