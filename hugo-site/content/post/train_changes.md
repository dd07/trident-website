In preparation for some upcoming changes, Project Trident will be deprecating the package repository based upon FreeBSD CURRENT (Trident-release). The 19.10 packages that are currently available on that repository will remain available but will no longer receive updates. The repository will be deleted at the end of December 2019.

We are planning on deprecating the STABLE package repository in the beginning of 2020, with a removal date planned for April of 2020. A summary of the timetables for the repository changes is provided below for reference.

## Future Updates
For long-term stability, Project Trident is hard at work migrating to an alternate operating system as the basis for the project, with a planned release in the beginning of 2020. 

As a quick teaser, in our tests with the new system, we are already experiencing faster boot times, daily app updates, newer hardware drivers, and bluetooth support. We will post additional information and details about this change in the near future, so please stay tuned!
