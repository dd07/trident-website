This is a general package update to the CURRENT release repository based upon TrueOS 19.07.

# EFI-Installer only
FreeBSD has broken their "vesa" driver which is required for legacy-boot systems in the Trident installer. If you have the option, you will need to enable booting via "EFI" or "UEFI" in order to go through the graphical installer. 
If you already have an installed Trident system with legacy boot and which currently uses an NVIDIA or AMD graphics driver, it is still safe to upgrade your system to this release (only the "vesa" driver is currently broken, which is used for no-GPU and some Intel-GPU systems). You can run `about` from a terminal to see which GPU driver your system is currently using.

FreeBSD Bug Report: https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=239065

We are currently working on an alternative installation method for legacy-boot systems. Stay tuned for more information.

# Important Notes
* "sysutils/hal" has been blacklisted from Project Trident and is no longer available in the package repository. This is due to a decade of bitrot and ongoing security concerns:
   * HAL was placed in [maintenance mode in May 2008](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/hal/)
   * The current HAL FreeBSD port (0.5.14) was [added in May 2010](https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/hal)
   * The last commit to the HAL sources was in [October 2011](https://cgit.freedesktop.org/hal/log/)
   * There are security concerns with HAL, including the "Bald Eagle" exploit which was [revealed in 2017](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_9535850.html).
* As a side effect of blacklisting the "hal" port, all ports which have an *explicit* dependency on hal are automatically ignored by the package build system and will no longer have packages available in the Project Trident repositories. Some of these packages include:
   * The XFCE desktop environment
   * The MATE desktop environment
   * The GNOME desktop environment
   * The Cinnamon desktop environment.
   * To notify the appropriate FreeBSD port maintainers about the HAL dependency issue, please create bug tickets on [bugs.freebsd.org](https://bugs.freebsd.org)
