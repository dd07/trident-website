# Introduction

Welcome to Project Trident!

Project Trident is a desktop distribution of [TrueOS](https://www.trueos.org), which is a rolling-release variant of [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org).
The goal of the Project is to provide a simple, secure, and highly usable FreeBSD experience.
Project Trident is completely independent and financially backed through the generous contributions of the Open Source community.

[Project Trident](https://project-trident.org) began in 2018 when TrueOS was reorganized into a scaled down server installation of FreeBSD.
The discontinued desktop portion of TrueOS was taken by Ken Moore and J.T. Pennington and rebuilt into Project Trident.

Project Trident is essentially a customized installation of TrueOS and FreeBSD, not a forked derivative.
Project Trident has a simple graphical installer that has partition support and other customization options.
The underlying TrueOS/FreeBSD system is kept intact and provides a fully functional FreeBSD system.
Other differences from FreeBSD include:

-   Project Trident pre-configures the BSD-licensed Lumina desktop environment.
    Additional desktop environments can be installed and appear in the graphical login menu.

-   The Project Trident installer supports configuring ZFS partitions during installation.

-   Project Trident has both graphical and command line software management systems.

-   Project Trident provides many graphical utilities for system configuration and management.

-   Project Trident comes pre-configured with a number of automatic scripts for dynamically configuring the graphics display system and other desktop-oriented automatic systems such as dynamically suppoerting removable media.

-   The Project Trident boot menu supports boot environments or snapshots of the operating system.
    The System Update Manager automatically creates a new boot environment before every update.
    If an update fails, the system can be rebooted into an earlier boot environment.
    This allows for easy recovery if any issues happen during the update process.

These articles cover the installation and use of Project Trident.
All documentation must be considered a "work in progress" and is wholly dependent on Project Trident community contributions.
